Description: Simulation of basic exam questions. Multiple choice
    tests can be simulated to find the expected score and compare
    with the corresponding binomial distribution,and tests 
    containing questions with different numbers of options
    can also be considered.There are also functions for fully
    customisable multiple choice and matching questions, allowing
    for multiple correct answers, negative points and customisable
    points for each correct option. An entire test of such
    questions can be constructed using a list and then simulated.
